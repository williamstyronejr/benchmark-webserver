# Benchmark Web Servers

Current Status: In Progress

## Motivation

Seen many benchmarking for languages that just focus on doing some amount of "work" but not something that is practical. So I'm testing how multiple languages on handling both http and tcp traffic.

## The Test

The test will be broken into multiple parts to test differnt situations.

1. Response to Http request
   1. Request to write data to a file
   2. Request to read data from a file

## Results
